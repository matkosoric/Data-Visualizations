Figures from Steven Pinker's book The Better Angels of Our Nature 
===================================================

Several percentages in a figure about a share of violent deaths are referencing only male population; to simplify, I neglected that information.
  
Steven Pinker's book:
[The Better Angels of Our Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature)


### The original Dataset

I copied the data for rate and share of violent deaths from Max Roser's article, where he was recreating numerical data used in Steven Pinker's figures.

### Created With
