Top 500 companies in Croatian IT 
===================================================




### Original DataSet

I used the data from a report about top 1000 companies in Croatian IT according to different criteria.
Then I merged them using Spark 2.4.
Some companies did not make it to final list intentionally, so that the combined dataset has all values in all columns.
