Visual Data Exploration: Air Quality Dataset
=======================================================

Visualizing a standard ML dataset concerning air quality. The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located in the field of a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Missing values are tagged with the -200 value, which is clearly visible on scatter plots and the heat map. I created two scatter plots: one is a mosaic display, and the other one a heat map; without any data pre-processing.

### The original Dataset

A dataset with air quality parameters was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

* [Air Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)


### Created With

* [Orange 3.4.1.](https://orange.biolab.si/) - Data mining tool
