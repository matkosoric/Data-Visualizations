Visual Data Exploration Air Quality Data Set
=======================================================

Visualizating standard ML dataset about air quality. The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Missing values are tagged with -200 value, which is clearly visible on scatter plots and heat map. I created two scatter plots, one mosaic display, and one heat map, without any data preprocessing.


### Original DataSet

Dataset with air quality parameters was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository:

* [Air Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)


### Created With

* [Orange 3.4.1.](https://orange.biolab.si/) - Data mining tool
